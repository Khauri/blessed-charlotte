This Chrome plug-in is under active development and will continue to be modified and improved over time. The current release is an "alpha."

### How to download

While this extension is not deployed, simply go to the repository using this link: https://github.com/dominionenterprises/blessed-charlotte and clone the repository on your computer.

Once deployed onto the Chrome Web Store, visit the Chrome Web Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions .
Then search for Charlotte's Web Scraper. Once you find it, click the "+ Add to Chrome" button.

### How to use

Simply click the extension button on the upper-right corner of your browser. Once you do, a pop-up window will appear and you can choose to either add a new search criteria, choose an existing search criteria, choose a tool to use, or delete an existing search criteria.
