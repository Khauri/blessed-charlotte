### Requirements

Google Chrome web browser and internet access. This extension should work with the latest version of Google's Chrome browser: 55.0.2883. 

### How to Install

While this extension is not deployed, simply go to the repository using this link: https://github.com/dominionenterprises/blessed-charlotte and clone the repository on your computer.

Once deployed onto the Chrome Web Store, visit the Chrome Web Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions .
Then search for Charlotte's Web Scraper. Once you find it, click the "+ Add to Chrome" button.

### How to use

When installed, the user can right-click on the web page, select all of one element type (e.g. prices for products on Amazon) with ALT+click or select multiple element types (e.g. the product names AND their prices) from the webpage the user is on and stores it into a database that can be converted into a .csv file. 

Simply click the extension button on the upper-right corner of your browser. Once you do, a pop-up window will appear and you can choose to either add a new search criteria, choose an existing search criteria, choose a tool to use, or delete an existing search criteria.

To add a new search criteria, simply click on a selector from the webpage and save the new search criteria.

After choosing a search criteria, the extension will automatically run and give you the option to export the data scraped into a .csv file.
